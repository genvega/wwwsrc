<p>After weeks of burning the midnight candle, I have just released the <a href="https://github.com/sdole/tvarit-maven/releases/tag/v0.1.1-alpha">first working alpha</a> of <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.tvarit.io">Tvarit</a> - a Dev Ops Automation tool for Amazon Web Services! It is in <a href="http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.tvarit%7Ctvarit-maven-plugin%7C0.1.1%7Cmaven-plugin">maven central</a>; give it a spin! I want to hear your <a href="https://github.com/sdole/tvarit-maven/issues/new">feedback<a/>. Does it work for you? What <a href="https://github.com/sdole/tvarit-maven/blob/master/README.md">documentation</a> should I add to make it clearer? 
</p>
<p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
In a nutshell, Tvarit enables a development team to completely automate deployment of a JEE WAR file to AWS. 
</p>
<p><ol>
    <li>1. Tomcat 8 application server with Java 8</li>
    <li>2. High availability via cross zone load balancing</li>
    <li>3. Completely automated infrastructure setup and deployment</li>
    <li>4. Scale horizontally using AWS's native autoscaling</li>
    <li>5. Customize using cloudformation templates (or use the default setup)</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2></p>
<p>This is already an exciting product. It can already shave of hours and hours of manual labor for a typical project running on the JEE platform! Here are some of the major enhancements I plan to make in the near future.
</p>
<p><ol>
    <li>1. Scale down previously running application versions</li>
    <li>2. Completely customizable application server environments</li>
    <li>3. Deploy with an RDS datasource with secured credentials<li>
    <li>4. Automatic independent environments for test and production</li>
    <li>5. Multi-app deployment and inter app-version contracts (Ã  la micro-services)</li>
    </ol>

<p>I am available for supporting Tvarit and for assessing your Dev Ops automation requirements. I am also available to discuss general AWS topics at your office, with your developers.
