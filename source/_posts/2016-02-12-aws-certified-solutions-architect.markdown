<p>The success of any AWS implementation inevitably depends on well communicated goals expressed in technical as well as commercial terms. Leaders tasked with transforming an IT organization must spend time and energy to communicate achievable targets, time frames and priorities throughout the organization. Who better to carry out this task then people whom Amazon Web Services certifies to be technically knowledgeable? To show my commitment to successful AWS implementations and to show solidarity with an IT leader's cause, I recently obtained the AWS Solutions Architect certification. This is just the first step in showcasing various levels of knowledge that Genvega and I can bring to the table for complex IT cloud projects. In future, I plan to take the AWS DevOps Engineer certification test. Watch this space!</p>
